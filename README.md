# Oracle Cloud Native Environment Integration Test Suite

Integration tests for the Oracle Cloud Native Environment platform and its
components live here.

## Documentation

These test require at least BATS 1.10

The structure of this suite is to run a common set of tests aginst a set of
cluster configuration.  Every test in this suite is run against each
configuration, for a total of (tests * configurations) assertions.

To run some tests, at least one test configuration is required.  Each test
configuration is a directory that contains a specific set of files:

* info.yaml - high level metadata about the test
  * provider - the cluster provider
  * version - the Kubernetes version
* defaults.yaml - A defaults.yaml to use as the defaults.
* clusterConfig.yaml - The cluster configuration file that defines the cluster.

Test configurations must be placed in a directory that contains only test
configurations.

Tests can be run like so:

`./run_tests.sh <tests-directory>`

The suite automatically configures an output directory for instrumented `ocne`
builds.  Instrumented builds can be generated by cloning
https://www.github.com/oracle-cne/ocne and running `make build-cli-instrumented`
